of my account which is ihaveclue69@gmail.com . As instructed by Zoe.

My accounts are Spinster and 2TFrutti .

I believe the hacker has transferred the items i had on 2TFrutti to his/her account.
I kindly request u to please retrieve my items from account of the hacker to which 
he/his had transferred my items . Spinster and 2TFrutti are my accounts.

I have contacted ourworld as instructed by you from my original email id of the account 2TFrutti .

I have also attached the screenshot of
the email from ourworld by which the hacked stole my account . 

I hope my account will be recovered as soon as possible.
